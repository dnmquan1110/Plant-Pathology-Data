# Plant_Pathology
Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7 is a competition on Kaggle. The mission is to indetify the category of foliar diseases in apple trees.

Specific objectives:

    1/ Accurately classify a given image from testing dataset into different diseased category or a healthy leaf

    2/ Accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on a single leaf

    3/ Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms

    4/ Address depth perceptionâ€”angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf

    5/ Incorporate expert knowledge in identification, annotation, quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant features during learning.

This is a Plant Pathology Classification with Tensorflow. In my kernel, I will visualize the data and create each folder for each category  of foliar diseases data images. Then, to increase the accuracy of the model, for each image
for training, I use RandomFlip, RandomRotation and RandomZoom for more data to train.
